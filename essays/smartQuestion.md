In the article [*How To Ask Questions The Smart Way*](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), Eric Raymond roasts those who are stupid, not necessarily in the sense that they are uneducated, but in the sense that they don’t put in any effort to educate themselves.  These “losers”, as Raymond calls them, frequently annoy those around them by asking stupid questions usually with high expectations for the responses.  To avoid being one of *those* people, one can learn how to ask questions in a way that reflect intelligence and a non-lazy attitude by following Raymond’s guidelines for effective communication.  

One example of a bad question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43719039/is-this-javascript-code-ok). This question has one of the lowest vote counts on the StackOverflow and was even closed because the question was so unclear.  It violates many of the principles Raymond covers.  For starters, the title is absolutely terrible; Raymond emphasizes the importance of meaningful subject headers.  One of the worst mistakes about the question is that...it’s not even a question.  Other than in the header, there’s no question in the description; the author just copies their code and asks if it’s incorrect.  It also seems like the author is just requesting an answer for a homework exercise from some site and doesn’t bother to rewrite the question or provide a direct link to it.  All of these issues and more contributed to only one response and complaints about the obscurity of the question.  

In comparison, [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array) is a smart question.  There’s a descriptive and concise title, specific instances of the run time results, and questions listed.  In agreement with Raymond’s guidelines, the author includes descriptions of their efforts and failed attempts.  

### My experience-
When I interned at RevaComm, it was expected of me to search online for tutorials and for help with fixing errors before bothering anyone. This was an effective way for me to learn how to problem solve on my own, as there are many situations where one would not have access to in-person assistance.  Knowing how to search the internet for similar questions and potential solutions is an important aspect of being a successful software engineer.  However, when I was unable to find help online, I would turn to my coworkers with a detailed explanation of my problem and what I had already attempted to remedy the issue.  There was once specific instance, however, where the miscommunication between myself and a client over data to be populated led to hours of wasted effort and confusion.  This incident really made me reflect on how important good communication and clarification is in the workplace.
