In the article [*How To Ask Questions The Smart Way*](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), Eric Raymond roasts those who are stupid, not necessarily in the sense that they are uneducated, but in the sense that they don’t put in any effort to educate themselves.  These “losers”, as Raymond calls them, frequently annoy those around them by asking stupid questions usually with high expectations for the responses.  To avoid being one of *those* people, one can learn how to ask questions in a way that reflect intelligence and a non-lazy attitude by following Raymond’s guidelines for effective communication.
