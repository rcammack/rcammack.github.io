Imagine you are faced with a problem similar to one you have previously encountered and successfully resolved. You are aware that the solution you used in the past worked well and is applicable to your current situation. Would you learn from your past experience and utilize (and perhaps modify) the known solution, or would you reapproach the problem from scratch? Clearly, not using the given solution is an inefficient way to go about solving the problem. 

In software design, it is common to encounter identical or very similar problems that can be solved with a common solution. In other words, many times there exists a general solution that is applicable to a variety of similar issues and can be used repeatedly in solving these issues. These solutions aer commonly referred to as *design patterns*. You can think of a design pattern as a template that serves as the base for solving problems in different situations. 

There are many different types of design patterns including those dealing with object/class structures, creation, and communication. In addition, there are anti-patterns which describe design patterns that should be avoided. 

Design patterns make a software engineer's life easier.  
faster, more efficient, more understandable/readable for other people who have used the same/similar design patterns
easier to describe

In my experience, design patterns have made it easier for me to understand other people's code since they used similar approaches as me. 

If you would like to read more about specific design patterns, [this article](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns) covers a few popular creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns. 


“What design patterns have you used in your own code?”
