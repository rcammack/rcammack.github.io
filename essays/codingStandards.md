### Why coding standards are beneficial-
Many programmers can't grasp the importance of following coding standards; they think that as long as their code compiles and runs properly, there's no harm in having strange indents and spacings in their code.  This may be an acceptable view to have for small individual projects, but not following some sort of coding standard in real world applications of software engineering can cause many problems.  I believe that being able to follow coding standards is an important quality to have in order to be a successful software engineer.  

It's clear that coding standards improve the readability of code.  When a file is more readable, people don't have to waste as much time deciphering the intentions of the code.  Having neat code is especially useful in team projects since it saves the time it takes to understand a team member's code and makes collaboration easier.  You can't assume that everyone else will be able to understand your code as well as you can if they are not familiar with your way of programming.  I know I definitely appreciate neat code when I'm trying to modify someone else's code or build off of it.  

Among the general benefits of having your code abide by coding standards, you can also more easily learn new programming languages by studying and writing code that is correctly structured.  Following coding standards can help you learn more languages by making it easier to read and therefore study, and through the use of proper indentation, it also helps you see what code is inside of what method particularly in the case of the nested elements. In general, neat code helps with understanding the structure and intent of a file or a function.

### Benefits of linter tools-
Although I find the picky spacing details annoying, once I get used to the formatting, it'll be a habit

The ESLint reminds you to follow coding standards and helps you form the habit of writing readable and well-organized code. 

ESLint helps catch your simple common errors in your code as well and saves time

ESLint is sometimes annoying because of some picky spacing specifications that I'm not used to following such as putting a space between 'for' and the following parenthesis.  

ESLint is useful but sometimes annoying, but it should get better since i should start getting less errors and once i become more familiar with the different common errors ESLint catches
