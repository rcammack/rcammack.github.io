### Why coding standards are beneficial-
Many programmers can't grasp the importance of following coding standards; they think that as long as their code compiles and runs properly, there's no harm in having strange indents and spacings in their code.  This may be an acceptable view to have for small individual projects, but not following some sort of coding standard in real world applications of software engineering can cause many problems.  I believe that being able to follow coding standards is an important quality in a successful software engineer.  

It's clear that coding standards improve the readability of code.  When a file is more readable, people don't have to waste 

Among the general benefits of having your code abide by coding standards, you can also more easily learn new programming languages by studying and writing code that is correctly organized.  

don't assume everyone else can understand your code as well as you can; they aren't the ones who have been working on it

I also really appreciate organization; I would say one of my greatest strengths is organization and that it is reflected in my code not just in file structure, but through the use of coding standards like correct spacing/indenting and frequent comments on lines of code that might not be initially obvious

readability -> don't waste as much time deciphering code
especially useful in team projects to save time and makes collaboration easier

Following coding standards can help people learn new programming languages by making it easier to read -> study -> helps you see what is inside of what/the nested elements and such
helps with understanding the structure of a file or a function

### Benefits of linter tools-
Although I find the picky spacing details annoying, once I get used to the formatting, it'll be a habit

The ESLint reminds you to follow coding standards and helps you form the habit of writing readable and well-organized code. 

ESLint helps catch your simple common errors in your code as well and saves time

ESLint is sometimes annoying because of some picky spacing specifications that I'm not used to following such as putting a space between 'for' and the following parenthesis.  

ESLint is useful but sometimes annoying, but it should get better since i should start getting less errors and once i become more familiar with the different common errors ESLint catches
