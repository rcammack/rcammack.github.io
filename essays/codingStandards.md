### Coding Standards-
improve readability
don't assume everyone else can understand your code as well as you can; they aren't the ones who have been working on it

Although I find the picky spacing details annoying, once I get used to the formatting, it'll be a habit
I also really appreciate organization; I would say one of my greatest strengths is organization and that it is reflected in my code not just in file structure, but through the use of coding standards like correct spacing/indenting and frequent comments on lines of code that might not be initially obvious

The ESLint reminds you to follow coding standards and helps you form the habit of writing readable and well-organized code. 
### Why Coding Standards are Beneficial-
Following coding standards can help people learn new programming languages by making it easier to read -> study -> helps you see what is inside of what/the nested elements and such
helps with understanding the structure of a file or a function

readability -> don't waste as much time deciphering code
especially useful in team projects to save time and makes collaboration easier
ESLint helps catch your simple common errors in your code as well and saves time

ESLint is sometimes annoying because of some picky spacing specifications that I'm not used to following such as putting a space between 'for' and the following parenthesis.  

ESLint is useful but sometimes annoying, but it should get better since i should start getting less errors and once i become more familiar with the different common errors ESLint catches
