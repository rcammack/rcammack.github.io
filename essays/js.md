## Learning JavaScript-
I used the programming language JavaScript for the first time this past summer for my internship. Prior to this, I had only ever used C/C++ and was excited to use another programming language and learn what benefits JavaScript has to offer software engineers. Through practice and by completing the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) JavaScript course, I became more familiar with the syntax of the language. However, the JavaScript files that I was creating all had very similar formats, so I never started writing a file from scratch. Since I only wrote in the new language for a specific purpose, writing the code became repetitive and I wasn't able to gain experience using many of the functions that JavaScript is capable of. Despite this, I was still able to appreciate the simplicity of the language and how much easier it was to learn than C/C++.

After using JavaScript in ICS 314, ...const, let, var, global scope block scope easier to declare variables console.log is useful and JS is easier to read than c/c++in my opinion blah i like the strictly equal/equal thing
the JavaScript can be dangerous to use for reasons such as var but in general it cool bro.  If you know what you're doing and are really confident you wont make any errors/are very careful to not get confused, then you good 

So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

## Practice makes perfect-
So that cliche saying "practice makes perfect" isn't exactly accurate when taken literally; conditioning won't guarentee a fail-safe state of perfection, but it will greatly increase your chances at success. By applying the concept of athletic software engineering, one can do a few generic programming questions a day (workout of the day) to learn new concepts and ways to solve problems. Even if some may seem rather simple, timing yourself and seeing other people's solutions which may be more efficient than yours is cool yeah ugh i need to finish thisssss
