## Choosing computer engineering
My personal philosophy of learning is centered around a hands-on experiential learning style integrated with a classroom learning style. This is the environment in which I retain the most information because I relate my knowledge gained from my courses at the University of Hawaii at Manoa to their respective applications in labs, internships, and other interactive learning environments. Even in high school, my favorite classes were AP Physics and Advanced Mixed Media, both of which engaged the students in experiential learning. The majority of classes that offered hands-on learning approaches were science courses such as chemistry and physics which integrated lab experiments into the classes. This is why I gravitated more towards a science based major in the first place. 

Since the high school I attended did not offer any computer related courses, I did not realize my interest in software engineering until I was exposed to programming in my freshman year of college as an electrical engineering major. Eventually, I switched majors and the more I studied, the more I realized how software engineering aligned with my interests and preferences that I've always had like algorithms and working in teams. I enjoy being able to use my programming skills to solve problems that can positively impact the society. I know that I made the right decision in switching to computer engineering, although I do wish that I had started studying components of computer engineering earlier in my life.
