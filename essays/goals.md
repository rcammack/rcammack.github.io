3-4 paragraphs that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future
Make the essay self-contained, self-explanatory, and useful to that random professional. Minimize the assumptions you make about that person’s software engineering background (much less their background in this class!) 
Not only should you write it for a variety of people, you should write it for a variety of times. In other words, try to write your essay such that if someone reads it in a year, it will still provide information of value. If you’re a newbie to the subject, then write it to provide insight and understanding to other newbies.
Help the reader understand this structure by providing internal headings. Don’t start with H1 (i.e. # in Markdown), as that’s reserved for the title of your post. Instead, start with H2 (## in markdown), then create subsections within that section with H3 (### in markdown), etc.

Similarly, use itemized or enumerated lists, tables, etc as appropriate.


I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.



My learning philosophy is centered around a hands-on experiential learning style integrated with a classroom learning style. This is the environment in which I retain the most information because I relate my knowledge gained from my courses at the University of Hawaii at Manoa to their respective applications in the learning experience of labs, internships, and other interactive learning environments. Even in high school, I excelled in the few classes that offered hands-on learning approaches such as chemistry and physics with their lab experiments integrated in the classes. This is why I gravitated more towards a science based major in the first place. In fact, my favorite classes in my senior year of high school were AP Physics and Advanced Mixed Media both of which engaged the students in experiential learning. So it does not surprise me that I really enjoy studying as a Computer Engineer.  

Since the high school I attended did not offer any computer related courses, I did not realize my interest in software engineering until I was exposed to programming in my freshman year of college as an electrical engineering major. After I learned more about computer engineering, I switched majors and I'm very glad I made that decision. 

After taking a variety of Computer Engineering courses, I started to notice that I prefer software over hardware
hope to learn more programming languages and actually utilize them in projects
