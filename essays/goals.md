Ever since I first grasped a paintbrush, I’ve always been eager to learn about design. Design is such a complex concept. For example, when looking at abstract art, its meaning can be completely different for different people. It motivates a person to think thoughtfully and has the potential to submerge them in a sea of imagination. It’s that special relationship between the viewer and the art that makes something as technical as software engineering interesting to me.

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.

create a technical essay (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future

I love working in a team, I always loved art class and math class. In high school...
My learning philosophy is centered around a hands-on learning style integrated with a classroom learning style.  This is the environment in which I retain the most information because I relate my knowledge gained from my classes at the University of Hawai’i at Manoa to their respective applications in the experiential learning experience of an internship.  Even in high school, I excelled in the few classes that offered hands-on learning approaches such as chemistry and physics with their experiments and labs.  I have always been more of a hands-on learner, so I think that is why I gravitated more towards a science based major in the first place.  In fact, my favorite classes in my senior year of high school were AP Physics and Advanced Mixed Media both of which engaged the students in experiential learning.  So it did not surprise me that I really enjoyed working as an intern since it required active participation and not just written homework assignments and midterms.  

After taking a variety of Computer Engineering courses, I started to notice that I prefer software over hardware
hope to learn more programming languages and actually utilize them in projects

or my first year and a half of college, my declared major was electrical engineering.  It was not until after I took the introductory programming class required for electrical engineering majors that I became interested in pursuing a degree in computer engineering, and even after taking that class I hesitated to switch majors because I did not want to commit to changing my major based off of my interest towards one class.  Since I did not even know what major I wanted to go into until my sophomore year of college, it will take me a while to discover what exact type of software development job I want in the future and I view internships as a way for me to try out different types of work to help me make that decision.
