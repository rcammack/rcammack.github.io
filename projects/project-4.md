For this project, my team used Android Studios and GitHub to design an app in Java to keep track of school assignments and set reminders for due dates.  The app uses an algorithm to list the tasks in order of a calculated priority value based off of the due date, duration, and importance level set by the user.  To keep track of the data for the multiple tasks, my team created a database for the task inputs using SQLite.  

When you open the app, you can add a new task or assignment by clicking the "+" icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.  Then you are prompted to input the following fields: title, course name, time required to complete, due date, and importance/weight.  You can also choose to set a reminder for the task in order to get a notification some custom amount of time before the due date.  After clicking the "add task" button, the task can be viewed in the list in a color determined by the characters of the class name.  The order of a task in the list is based on its priority.  You can click on a task to view, edit and save, or delete the task.  To mark a task as complete, you can hold down on the task in the list view.  

My role in this project included developing and writing the algorithm to calculate the priority of a task based on the due date, duration, and weight of the assignment.  In the beginning of the project, I organized my team's ideas into a doable timeline.  I also was the debugger and verified that our app was working properly at many intervals.  In addition, I played a big part in the design for the user interface.  

Throughout this project, I was able to become more familiar with the programming languages SQLite and Java.  I also familiarized myself with Android Studios and how to use it to design a user-friendly app.  I was able to gain public speaking skills through the experience as well since the project included a final presentation at the end of the semester with a short demo on how our app operates. 

(1) what the project was about; (2) what your role was and how much of the work you were responsible for; and (3) what did you learn from the experience?
