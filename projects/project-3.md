In a small team, I designed and implemented an Android app in Java to keep track of school assignments and set reminders for due dates. The app uses an algorithm to list the tasks in order of a calculated priority based off of the due date, duration of assignment, and importance level set by the user. To keep track of the data, my team created a database for the task inputs using SQLite.

My role in this project included developing and writing the algorithm to calculate the priority of a task based on the due date, duration, and weight of the assignment. In the beginning of the project, I organized my team's ideas into a doable timeline. I also was the debugger and verified that our app was working properly at many intervals. In addition, I played a big part in the design for the user interface. 

Throughout this project, I was able to learn how to use the programming languages SQLite and Java. I also familiarized myself with Android Studios and how to use it to design a well designed app. I also was able to gain public speaking skills through the experience since the project also included a final presentation in front of our class at the end of the semester including a short demo on how our app operates followed by answering questions from the class and teacher.
